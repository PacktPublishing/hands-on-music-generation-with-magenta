# Hands-On Music Generation with Magenta

[![Magenta Version 1.1.7](./docs/magenta-v1.1.7-badge.svg)](https://github.com/magenta/magenta/releases/tag/1.1.7)

In Hands-On Music Generation with Magenta, we explore the role of deep learning in music generation and assisted music composition. Design and use machine learning models for music generation using Magenta and make them interact with existing music creation tools.

- [**Magenta v1.1.7** (in the `master` branch)](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/hands-on-music-generation-with-magenta) - The book's code uses Magenta 1.1.7 which, at the time of publication, was the latest stable available version. The code for that version is in the default `master` branch and will stay there.
- [**Magenta HEAD (master)** (in the `magenta-master` branch)](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/hands-on-music-generation-with-magenta/tree/magenta-master) - We also provide the code for newer versions of Magenta, we try to keep the code up-to-date when new (breaking) versions of Magenta are released.
    - [**Magenta v2.0.1** (the `magenta-v2.0.1` tag)](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/hands-on-music-generation-with-magenta/releases/tag/magenta-v2.0.1) - Corresponds to [Magenta 2.0.1](https://github.com/magenta/magenta/releases/tag/2.0.1), should work with all 2.0.x versions.
    - [**Magenta v2.1.2** (the `magenta-v2.1.2` tag)](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/hands-on-music-generation-with-magenta/releases/tag/magenta-v2.1.2) - Corresponds to [Magenta 2.1.2](https://github.com/magenta/magenta/releases/tag/2.1.2), should work with all 2.1.x versions.
